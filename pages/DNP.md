- POC - overall feedback on the changes made: Okay
  
  General comments
  1. Process feedback related to BOM
- after BOM is submitted, it should come to the provisionoing team. Once they review it, then they can send it to the custome for review. 
  
  2. user will get a copy of BOM via email; they should be able to adownload BOM from within the DNP solutoin tab
  
  3. in the current process, for creating DNP, user copy various tables from BOM and send it to the supplier for quotes. the solution should allow user to replicate the process. Similary when vendor responds with the quotes against part, user should be able to paste the same back into the solution.
